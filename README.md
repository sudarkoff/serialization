serialization
=============

Blazingly fast and size-efficient C++ serialization library.

This is most of the serialization library (with the proprietary bits removed) I wrote in 2006. It uses a fair amount of boost's MPL library. Added here so I could later compare this C++98 code with the equivalent (-ish) C++11 code.
